## Interests
I'm interested in many things. Here is the list of some of them:
- Bugging my boyfriend.
- Being Bagger queen
- Programming
- Climing
- Drawing
- Petting my dog
- Singing in the shower
- Machine Learning (Logistic function: $$ \sigma(x) = \frac{e^x}{e^x + 1} $$)

If you are wondering how my dog looks like:

In summer:

Most cudly dog on earth => Tori

Besides my dog I'm also owner of three cats

All three of them are so soft you could die. (I'm going to upload the pictures of them later.)
