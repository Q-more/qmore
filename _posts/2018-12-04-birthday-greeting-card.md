This is a story of how I got my birthday greeting card.

# Intro

So I started a tradition with my boyfriend that we will give each others a greeting cards for our birthdays.
His birthday was first so I made him most cringyyyy gift card ever.
I taped all of his faces I could find on internet, phone, private collection, etc. to one gift card.
(You are not so lucky to see this gift card)

# Boyfriend perspective
- Got gift card
- Gift card full of his stupid faces
- Make a revenge plan
- Make public github page and upload girlfriend stupid faces
- Le me cool

# Boyfriend gift card creation process (execution)

So he tought this will be easy. He tought that web devs built this jekyll tool for stupid people like him, and that he will only be concerned with content part. He tought it will go something like this:
- Look at other github Pages
- Find one that you think is looking good
- Steal the theme
- Add some super duper content
- Present this github page to girlfriend
- Have a big laught
- Pray to God she does not freak out when she finds out that this is public.

But ofc this did not happen. Instead this happened:
- Look at other github Pages
- Find one that you think is looking good
- Steal the theme (Clone repo)
- Figure out that it's not so good idea to clone repo
- Delete cloned repo and then duplicate that repo
- Open project in atom and figure out that you have no idea how this works
- Cry a bit
- Start changing things and destroy the inital web page template
- Delete everything and start over
- Read all docs. Still not able to figure out this shit.
- Figure out that themes do not contain docs for working with jekyll.
- Read jekyll docs.
- Figure out (more or less) how does this jekyll shit works.
- After 4h do first markdown post (even though you know how to write markdown).
- Another 4h to make this post.

Thankfully for me my BF is not really creative and he was unable to make (not) so awsome greeting card, he was only able to manage create cringy collage of me (created by google photos).
